# Roll Store
This is project number 3 for Object Oriented Analysis and Design (CSCI-4448).

#Team Members
Project completed by Jacob Malcy, Kyle Stewart, and Vincent Liu.

#Description
The 3 distinct design patterns we used were Strategy, Decorator, and Factory. 
We used strategy to handle the different cost of extras per different type of roll. 
Decorator was used to handle adding toppings to each roll.
Factory was used for both creating orders and also creating the rolls.
